# CWOJ
An online judge system used by Chengdu Foreign Languages School.
This project is still not finished so redeveloping is not recommended at the moment.
#
CWOJ is based on Bashu Onlinejudge, which could also be found on github. We appreciate Bashu Onlinejudge's authors for sharing their codes to push the development of the internet world.
#
However, compared with the original Bashu Online Judge, we have also done some improvements:
1. Fully translated into Chinese.
2. Optimizations for Mobile devices (including a new navagation bar and css modifications).
3. Auto night mode (still unfinished).
4. Minor improvements to enchance the whole experience.
#
Plus, we would like to thank those open source projects that we've been using as the framework. Their great work has made the development so much easier.

You will be able to find the installation notes in the Wiki page in a month. Thanks for your support!
