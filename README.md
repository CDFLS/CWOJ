CWOJ is based on Bashu Onlinejudge, which could also be found on github. We appreciate Bashu Onlinejudge's authors for sharing their codes to push the development of the internet world.
Plus, we would like to thank those open source projects that we've been using as the framework. Their great work has made the developing such projects so much easier.
# Features
Compared with the original Bashu Online Judge, we have also done some improvements:<br>
1. Fully translated into Chinese.<br>
2. Optimizations for Mobile devices (including a new navagation bar and css modifications).<br>
3. Auto night mode (Basically finished).<br>
4. Minor improvements to enchance the whole experience.<br>
5. Forget Password (Still Working on it...)

# Notes
