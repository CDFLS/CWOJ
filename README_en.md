# CWOJ
An online judge system used by Chengdu Foreign Languages School.
CWOJ is based on Bashu Onlinejudge, which could also be found on github. We appreciate Bashu Onlinejudge's authors for sharing their codes to push the development of the internet world.
Plus, we would like to thank those open source projects that we've been using as the framework. Their great work has made the developing such projects so much easier.
     
Notes: 1.x is still in an early development stage, which means it contains loads of half-done codes. Additionally, there're some changes in database. So anything else than evaluation is not recommended.
